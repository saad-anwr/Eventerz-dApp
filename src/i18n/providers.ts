/**
 * Where translations actually come from.
 *
 * Two providers, because they solve different problems:
 *
 *   **MyMemory** is the default and needs no configuration at all. It is free,
 *   keyless, and - verified against every script this app lists - returns real
 *   translations for Japanese, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Swahili and the rest.
 *   That is what makes the language picker work out of the box rather than
 *   being a menu that does nothing until someone provisions a server.
 *
 *   **LibreTranslate** is used instead the moment `EXPO_PUBLIC_TRANSLATE_URL`
 *   is set. It is the one to run in production: self-hostable, no per-request
 *   quota, and it takes a whole batch in a single POST.
 *
 * # The quota, stated plainly
 *
 * MyMemory's anonymous tier is roughly 5,000 characters per day per IP (about
 * 50,000 with an email address in `EXPO_PUBLIC_TRANSLATE_EMAIL`). That is
 * generous for one person exploring the app and nowhere near enough for a real
 * user base - the whole UI is a few thousand characters, so a handful of users
 * on a fresh cache would exhaust it. The disk cache means each string is paid
 * for once, but a launch still needs LibreTranslate behind
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_TRANSLATE_URL`.
 *
 * When the quota runs out the app keeps working in English rather than showing
 * an error, and `quotaExhausted()` reports it so the UI can say why.
